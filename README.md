## Welcome 

This project is my graduation project.   

It is a series games that teach programming based on Google Blockly Library, like Google's Blockly-games. So I use the same name.

I didn't do this project alone, but with three another classmates.One designed UI, one planned game patterns and levels, one developed with me.    

Thanks all for efforts.
